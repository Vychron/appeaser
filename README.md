# Appeaser

A game made for my application at the BUas.

## Story

The game is takes place on a graveyard that has been abandoned, causing the buried spirits to grow restless.
It is your task to appease the spirits by visiting their graves and bring them flowers to make them feel remembered.

The around the graveyard there's a strange energy pulsing around, and the waves of energy that flow over the graveyard energize the graves, including the ground below.
When too much energy gathers in the ground below a grave, the restless spirit reanimates its body and will submerge from the earth to walk among the living once more, but not in good will.

The reanimated bodies will chase you down as long as you don't try to send it back by throwing garlic at it.
